<p><span>Hello World!</span> I'm Leonardo Martínez (just in case you haven't noticed yet). I'm from Caracas, Venezuela and 
  I graduated from Universidad Simón Bolívar in Computer Engineering on December 2018. 
</p>

<p> It's been a long journey since I started coding. My fist approaches to some real-life projects where in web development, 
  using frameworks like <span>Django</span>, <span>Web2py</span> and <span>AngularJS</span>. However, since my college internships 
  in June 2017 at <a href="https://smarthop.co/" target="_blank">SmartHop</a> I've been working in Data Mining and Data Science, using 
  Artificial Intelligence algorithms to deliver solutions and insights to solve transport logistic problems.
</p>

<p> During my time as a college student I was part of <a href="https://grupodelu.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">DELU</a>, Universidad Simón Bolívar's video game development group.
    Although I don't make games anymore, I strongly believe they're a great way of learning new things. Whenever I'm trying out a new programming language or framework,
    I use my game developer side to understand concepts, objects, and user interactions. 
</p>

<p> My academic and work experience has thaught me that communication and team work are fundamental skills for developers, and so I feel confident with agile development
    methodologies like <span>SCRUM</span> that promote this kind of work.
</p>

<p> Reading and learning languages are among my hobbies. Spanish is my native language, but I consider myself a decent English speaker
  and an enthusiast of French!. Right now, my goals are focused on improving my experience and knowlege in Data Science, Data Mining and Data Engineering 
  since I've found them to be extremely useful nowadays and few people in Venezuela are working in these areas. 
</p>

<p> In this site you'll find a <a href="/projets" target="_blank"> list of my favorite projects.</a>
    I'm grateful to have worked in these projects with my friends or colleagues, who are excellent programmers and professionals. You'll also find a simple and - I hope - <a href="/cv" target="_blank">updated CV.</a>
