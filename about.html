<p> <span>Hello World!</span> I'm Leonardo Martínez - just in case you haven't noticed yet - and
    I'm a Computer Engineering Student at Universidad Simón Bolívar. I currently live in Caracas, Venezuela.
</p>

<p> I love writing code. In the last year I've worked with <span>AngularJS</span>, <span>Web2py</span>, <span>WordPress</span> and <span>Django</span>
    for web development. I have also started working with Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reallity
    in the past months.
</p>

<p> As a former member of <a href="https://grupodelu.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">DELU</a>, Universidad Simón Bolívar's video game development group, I've created a few video games.
    In fact, along with <a href="https://github.com/aldrix" target="_blank">Aldrix Marfil</a>, we've won <b>Venezuela's Duel Jam 2</b> in 2016 with a small game called
    <a href="http://leotms.itch.io/fantasmotel" target="_blank">Fantasmotel</a>, developed from scratch in 48 hours.
</p>

<p> I think comunication and team work are fundamental skills for developers, and so I feel confident with agile development
    methodologies like <span>SCRUM</span> that promote this kind of work.
</p>

<p> Reading and learning languages are among my hobbies. I also consider myself a fast learner. In the future I'd like to
  explore more about Android and Web Development.
</p>

<p> In this site you'll find a <a href="/projets" target="_blank"> list of my recent projects</a>
  - not all of them, just my favourite ones - and my <a href="/cv" target="_blank">detailed CV.</a>
