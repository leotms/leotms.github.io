Closettine was one of the first big project I had to work in when I started working for [Inpetus](http://inpetus.com/). The main idea was to help this small startup to create a simple website where they could test their MVP, a second hand clothing selling website.

I started alone, styling, building and adapting WordPress and WooCommerce to the requirements. Later on [Daniel Leones](https://bitbucket.org/dleones/) started working with me, helping in both front-end and back-end. This project represented a big challenge for me, because it was the first time I had to deal face-to-face with a external
client and make almost everything by myself.

First prototipe was developed -half-time- from November 2016 to March 2017. The site was accesible through the domain
[closettine.com](http://www.closettine.com) until March 2017. Current status of this project is unknown to me, since I stopped working in it after first prototipe was released.
