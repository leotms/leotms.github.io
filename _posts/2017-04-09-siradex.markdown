SIRADEx is one of my most recent projects and figures as one of the most satisfactory as well. As a part
of the Information Systems elective, students are supposed to work in teams to create a new Information System
(or continue a previous one) to an USB dependency.

In this case *Prometheus* (my team) and *Morpheus* had to work in SIRADEx, for the Extension Deanery. SIRADEx is a system that helps register, approve and consult all Extension Activities carried out by university community members.

We work together for about 7 months and we ended up with a system that had 100% approval as a first version
for the use of the Extension Deanery.

I was selected by my teammates as Team Leader, buy I also did some heavy work in programming and refactoring some of the modules. The Project used Web2py, a Python framework for web development, and PostgreSQL as database.

SIRADEx can be accessed [through its official site](http://siradex.dex.usb.ve). Visitors have access to make public searces, only USB members can log in.
