Asteroids was the first game I ever created alongside [Aldrix Marfil](https://github.com/aldrix), who made an awesome work with the art of the game. The game consist mainly of helping Astro, our astronaut friend, move
through space and avoid obstacles to reach his spaceship.

It was developed using [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/). More info and download links for the beta releases of the game can be found in [the project's repository](https://github.com/aldrix/Asteroids-Game). The game source code is also available there.

Here are some screenshots of the game:
