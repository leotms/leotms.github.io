The idea of this project, as part of the assingment in the Artificial Intelligence elective, was to implement
K-Means algoritm to compress an image, by classifing its pixels into clusters. This was, in my oppinion, the most simple yet funniest of all projects in this elective.

Several image examples can be found inside the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/leotms/IAII_III). I've worked in this project with [Nicol치s Ma침an](https://github.com/nmanan) and [Joel Rivas](https://github.com/JoelRg). We used several python libraries to make this project work: Pandas and Numpy for data reading/processing and PIL to work with images.
