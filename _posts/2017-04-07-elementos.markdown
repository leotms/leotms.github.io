<span>ElementOs</span> is a small interactive Augmented Reallity game created using Unity 5.5.0 and [ARToolKit](https://artoolkit.org).
This was the first project for the area elective *Augmented Reallity* at USB. [Patricia Valencia](https://github.com/patriv) and
[Cinthya Ramos](https://github.com/CinthyaRamos) were my teammates this time.

The game works using a direct interaction system, since the user manipulates the augmented objects. It also
works as an educational game, the user can learn in a simple way how real world materials like glass and pottery are created.

There are a total of 19 elements in the game, 4 of them are the basic natural elements -water, earth, fire and air-. The 15 other elements can be created through combination.

More information about this project - and its source code- are available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/leotms/ElementOs)
