FantasMotel is a simple videogame created in 48hrs for the Venezuela Duel Jam 2. It was created by me (programming) and [Aldrix Marfil](https://github.com/aldrix) (art). The game was the winner of this Game Jam, voted by all the contestants.

It was developed using [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/). More info and download links for FantasMotel
can be found in [its itchio page](https://leotms.itch.io/fantasmotel).

Here are some screenshots of the game:
