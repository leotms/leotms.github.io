A long time ago, [Sahid Reyes](https://github.com/sahidr) had lot's of fun retweeting and 
interacting with [bot_me_daddy](https://twitter.com/bot_me_daddy), a Twitter bot created by
[Jake Farris ](https://twitter.com/fake_jaris) with only purpose is to tweet every verb in english, followed by "me + daddy". *i.e.: **code me daddy*** 

We thought, "Hey, why don't we create a vertion of this bot, but in spanish?", since we know it'd
produce some fun tweets (Spanish is our native language), so we got to work. 

You can think "why putting a side project like this in your website?" Well, we learned a few things on the way:

**1. Spanish conjugation is, indeed, harder!** There are a lot of rules, exceptions and special cases, acentuation is different deppending on every word. Also, we descover this kind of spanish conjugation is called *enclitic form*, so we needed to do more research. 

**2. Gathering the verbs was quite a task.** We found few to none free sources of spanish verbs. Leading us to collect and conjugate most of them (manually). We collected more than 2.800, adding 
some venezuelan regionalisms to spice things a little.

**3. Did you know many of developers make bots in twitter just for fun?** Well, we know now. After creating PapiBot, we contacted Jake, which showed really excited about it, and even helped us with his own list of verbs!. Also, I could personnaly get in touch for the first time with [Ciro Duran](https://twitter.com/chiguire), an AWESOME venezuelan game developer which I personnaly admire and, casually, also happens to make twitter bots and was really curious about how we created this bot.

**4. Watching user interactions with our bot is INCREDIBLE!** We see everyday how people from all arround the world (most of them latin americans or spanish speakers) interact with every tweet and have lots of fun with it. Every day a new verb comes out and people creativity shines.

**5. It made me more aware of the huge Developing Comunity in Twitter.** And now I read more from developers arround the world about their most interesting experiences and advises in tech industry.

**6. It was FUN.** And I do think this is the most important lesson. I strongly believe you learn
the most when you're creating something you enjoy, regardless it is just for fun and there's no live-changing reason behind it.
 
If your curious and wanna give a follow to our bot, just go check [PapiBot on Twitter](https://twitter.com/botmepapi). We are continously adding new verbs, when it reaches a certain point we'll release its verb list so other people can use them to create more interesting and funny things too!
